Improved Lisp package for Sublime Text 3.

Includes:
- build systems for SBCL and Clozure CL
- minor sensible settings for Lisp files
- default comment syntax in `#||` and `||#` shape (for Emacs compatibility)
- revamped Lisp language scoping covering more syntax (originally based on [baskerville's](https://github.com/baskerville/Common-Lisp.tmbundle) for TextMate)
